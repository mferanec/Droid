Hello and thank you for looking at my Java code.

This project began as an idea to expand a Java tutorial that I've seen online as I wanted to explore the possibilities of Java and to practice.

In time I have created and developed this into a text based game in which the 'Droid' can be moved on a gameboard while hovering(as it doesn't
have any legs or wheels), depleting its battery as it moves and also includes randomly generated mines with proximity warning if on(or more)
are nearby.

Although having a text based game felt pleasantly retro, I wondered how could I create more visual game. That's how my second project,
VisualDroid, was born.
